abstract = {The heart actively remodels architecture in response to various physiological and pathological conditions. Gross structural change of the heart chambers is directly reflected at the cellular level by altering the morphological characteristics of individual cardiomyocytes. However, an understanding of the relationship between cardiomyocyte shape and the contractile function remains unclear. By using in vitro assays to analyze systolic stress of cardiomyocytes with controlled shape, we demonstrated that the characteristic morphological features of cardiomyocytes observed in a variety of pathophysiological conditions are correlated with mechanical performance. We found that cardiomyocyte contractility is optimized at the cell length/width ratio observed in normal hearts, and decreases in cardiomyocytes with morphological characteristics resembling those isolated from failing hearts. Quantitative analysis of sarcomeric architecture revealed that the change of contractility may arise from alteration of myofibrillar structure. Measurements of intracellular calcium in myocytes revealed unique characteristics of calcium metabolism as a function of myocyte shape. Our data suggest that cell shape is critical in determining contractile performance of single cardiomyocytes by regulating the intracellular structure and calcium handling ability. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Society for Investigative Pathology.},

abstract = {The Turing, or reaction-diffusion (RD), model is one of the best-known theoretical models used to explain self-regulated pattern formation in the developing animal embryo. Although its real-world relevance was long debated, a number of compelling examples have gradually alleviated much of the skepticism surrounding the model. The RD model can generate a wide variety of spatial patterns, and mathematical studies have revealed the kinds of interactions required for each, giving this model the potential for application as an experimental working hypothesis in a wide variety of morphological phenomena. In this review, we describe the essence of this theory for experimental biologists unfamiliar with the model, using examples from experimental studies in which the RD model is effectively incorporated.},

@article{Drew2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by ASME.In a properly contracting cardiac muscle, many different subcellular structures are organized into an intricate architecture. While it has been observed that this organization is altered in pathological conditions, the relationship between length-scales and architecture has not been properly explored. In this work, we utilize a variety of architecture metrics to quantify organization and consistency of single structures over multiple scales, from subcellular to tissue scale as well as correlation of organization of multiple structures. Specifically, as the best way to characterize cardiac tissues, we chose the orientational and co-orientational order parameters (COOPs). Similarly, neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were selected for their consistent architectural behavior. The engineered cells and tissues were stained for four architectural structures: actin, tubulin, sarcomeric z-lines, and nuclei. We applied the orientational metrics to cardiac cells of various shapes, isotropic cardiac tissues, and anisotropic globally aligned tissues. With these novel tools, we discovered: (1) the relationship between cellular shape and consistency of self-assembly; (2) the length-scales at which unguided tissues self-organize; and (3) the correlation or lack thereof between organization of actin fibrils, sarcomeric z-lines, tubulin fibrils, and nuclei. All of these together elucidate some of the current mysteries in the relationship between force production and architecture, while raising more questions about the effect of guidance cues on self-assembly function. These types of metrics are the future of quantitative tissue engineering in cardiovascular biomechanics.},

@article{Haque2010,
abstract = {The nuclear envelope (NE) LINC complex, in mammals comprised of SUN domain and nesprin proteins, provides a direct connection between the nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton, which contributes to nuclear positioning and cellular rigidity. SUN1 and SUN2 interact with lamin A, but lamin A is only required for NE localization of SUN2, and it remains unclear how SUN1 is anchored. Here, we identify emerin and short nesprin-2 isoforms as novel nucleoplasmic binding partners of SUN1/2. These have overlapping binding sites distinct from the lamin A binding site. However, we demonstrate that tight association of SUN1 with the nuclear lamina depends upon a short motif within residues 209-228, a region that does not interact significantly with known SUN1 binding partners. Moreover, SUN1 localizes correctly in cells lacking emerin. Importantly then, the major determinant of SUN1 NE localization has yet to be identified. We further find that a subset of lamin A mutations, associated with laminopathies Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), disrupt lamin A interaction with SUN1 and SUN2. Despite this, NE localization of SUN1 and SUN2 is not impaired in cell lines from either class of patients. Intriguingly, SUN1 expression at the NE is instead enhanced in a significant proportion of HGPS but not EDMD cells and strongly correlates with pre-lamin A accumulation due to preferential interaction of SUN1 with pre-lamin A. We propose that these different perturbations in lamin A-SUN protein interactions may underlie the opposing effects of EDMD and HGPS mutations on nuclear and cellular mechanics.},

abstract = {Lamins, the major components of the nuclear lamina, have gained rapidly increasing interest over the past decade as lamin mutations were found to cause numerous devastating diseases. These laminopathies include Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), dilated cardiomyopathy type 1A, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B, familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD), Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 2, mandibuloacral dysplasia and the segmental premature ageing diseases Hutchinson– Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) and atypical Werner's progeria. Altered lamin expression has also been reported in various cancers. The molecular mechanism underlying these diverse diseases remains unclear. As such, much effort has been devoted to characterizing the physical and biochemical properties of lamins and their role in cellular function. Here,we provide an overview of the diverse functions of nuclear lamins and how defects in these functions – caused by mutations or altered expression – can contribute to human disease.},

Over 180 mutations in these genes are associated with at least 13 known diseases--the laminopathies. In particular, the study of LMNA, its products and the phenotypes that result from its mutation have provided important insights into subjects ranging from transcriptional regulation, the cell biology of the nuclear lamina and mechanisms of ageing. Recent studies have begun the difficult task of correlating the genotypes of laminopathies with their phenotypes, and potential therapeutic strategies using existing drugs, modified oligonucleotides and RNAi are showing real promise for the treatment of these diseases.},

abstract = {The nuclear lamina forms a protein mesh that underlies the nuclear membrane. In most mammalian cells it contains the intermediate filament proteins, lamins A, B and C. As their name indicates, lamins are generally thought to be confined to the nuclear periphery. We now show that they also form part of a diffuse skeleton that ramifies throughout the interior of the nucleus. Unlike their peripheral counterparts, these internal lamins are buried in dense chromatin and so are inaccessible to antibodies, but accessibility can be increased by removing chromatin. Knobs and nodes on an internal skeleton can then be immunolabelled using fluorescein- or gold-conjugated anti-lamin A antibodies. These results suggest that the lamins are misnamed as they are also found internally.},

abstract = {A canard is a false bifurcation in which the amplitude of an oscillatory system may change by orders of magnitude while the qualitative dynamical features remain unchanged. Recent theoretical considerations suggest that canards are characteristic of fast-slow dynamical systems and are associated with the stable and unstable manifolds of the phase plane. An alternative characterization of canard behaviour is proposed involving the crossing of an inflection line by a limit cycle growing out from an unstable stationary state. The inflection line comprises the locus of points at which the curvature of any phase plane trajectory is zero. The role of the inflection line in the onset of canard behaviour as well as in the continuity of the transition is examined in a two-variable model for the oscillatory EOE reaction, the Autocatalator, and the two-variable Oregonator. The approach is also applied to the van der Pol oscillator, the system in which canard behaviour was first examined.},

Whereas in the absence of cell-substrate adhesions through fibronectin{,} the same cells migrate by producing blebs and {"}chimneying{"} between the gel sheets. To identify the orientation and to quantify the magnitude of the traction forces{,} we found by traction force microscopy that expanding blebs push into the gels and generate anchoring stresses whose magnitude increases with decreasing gap size while the resulting migration speed is highest at an intermediate gap size. To understand why there exists such an optimal gap size for migration{,} we developed a computational model and showed that the chimneying speed depends on both the magnitude of intracellular pressure as well as the distribution of blebs around the cell periphery. The model also predicts that the optimal gap size increases with weakening cell membrane to actin cortex adhesion strength. We verified this prediction experimentally{,} by weakening the membrane-cortex adhesion strength using the ezrin inhibitor{,} baicalein. Thus{,} the chimneying mode of amoeboid migration requires a balance between intracellular pressure and membrane-cortex adhesion strength."}

@article{Worman2004,
abstract = {Mutations in lamins A and C, nuclear intermediate-filament proteins in nearly all somatic cells, cause a variety of diseases that primarily affect striated muscle, adipocytes, or peripheral nerves or cause features of premature aging. Two new studies (see the related articles beginning on pages 357 and 370) use lamin A/C-deficient mice, which develop striated muscle disease, as a model to investigate pathogenic mechanisms. These reports provide evidence for a stepwise process in which mechanically stressed cells first develop chromatin and nuclear envelope damage and then develop secondary alterations in the transcriptional activation of genes in adaptive and protective pathways.},

@article{Taimen2009,
abstract = {Numerous mutations in the human A-type lamin gene (LMNA) cause the premature aging disease, progeria. Some of these are located in the alpha-helical central rod domain required for the polymerization of the nuclear lamins into higher order structures. Patient cells with a mutation in this domain, 433G{\textgreater}A (E145K) show severely lobulated nuclei, a separation of the A- and B-type lamins, alterations in pericentric heterochromatin, abnormally clustered centromeres, and mislocalized telomeres. The induction of lobulations and the clustering of centromeres originate during postmitotic nuclear assembly in daughter cells and this early G1 configuration of chromosomes is retained throughout interphase. In vitro analyses of E145K-lamin A show severe defects in the assembly of protofilaments into higher order lamin structures. The results show that this central rod domain mutation affects nuclear architecture in a fashion distinctly different from the changes found in the most common form of progeria caused by the expression of LADelta50/progerin. The study also emphasizes the importance of lamins in nuclear assembly and chromatin organization.},

@article{Wang2010,
abstract = {Cells in the musculoskeletal system are subjected to various mechanical forces in vivo. Years of research have shown that these mechanical forces, including tension and compression, greatly influence various cellular functions such as gene expression, cell proliferation and differentiation, and secretion of matrix proteins. Cells also use mechanotransduction mechanisms to convert mechanical signals into a cascade of cellular and molecular events. This mini-review provides an overview of cell mechanobiology to highlight the notion that mechanics, mainly in the form of mechanical forces, dictates cell behaviors in terms of both cellular mechanobiological responses and mechanotransduction.},
