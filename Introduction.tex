\chapter{Introduction}

It is known that both chemical dynamics and mechanics play important roles in biological systems. One approach to studying the interplay between the two is through mathematical modelling. The application of mathematical models to the field of biology has a long history but with more recent technological advances in things like computational power, the type of models we can built and simulate are becoming ever more complex and holistic. Since
