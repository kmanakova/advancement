\section{ODE Analysis}

The ODE system obtained by removing the spatial term in Equation ~\ref{eq::nondimyM} can exhibit a variety of behaviours numerically (Fig. ~\ref{fig::odeanal}).

We swept through two parameters, $\epsilon$ and $\Omega$, in order to study the transitions between these behaviours, see Fig. ~\ref{fig::epsomega}. We note that the oscillatory behaviours of the ODE system is dependent on the fast-slow dynamics established by small values of $\epsilon$. We conjecture that the second transition into the oscillating regime, along decreasing values of $\Omega$ and for small values of $\epsilon$, occurs in conjunction with a canard explosion. A canard explosion is a false bifurcation arise near a hopf bifurcation and is characterized by a jump from a single steady state solution to large amplitude oscillations with a small change in the parameter, see Fig [REFERENCE FIGURE]. This is a known feature exhibited by some fast-slow dynamical systems[REFERENCE].

We plan to demonstrate that our transition to oscillations is in fact a canard explosion by performing a two parameter bifurcation analysis to characterize the bifurcation lines and find the so-called {\textit{canard}} point at which the oscillations appear to jump. The resulting bifurcation diagram might look something like Fig. ~\ref{fig::bifplot}.
