\section{Future work} \label{sec:futurework}

The goal of this work is to reliably reproduce nuclear shape deformations. This requires a symmetry break in the system governing laminar assembly/disassembly dynamics. We plan to achieve this by including a feedback term in the functions $k_{off}^{a,b}$. Hypothesized sources of feedback include competition between lamin types, and stress induced feedback. These ideas are shown schematically in Fig. ~\ref{fig::feedback}. Once we have established a symmetry break, we will explore perturbations to the model which correspond to physical changes  in the lamin A/C protein which can best reproduce patient versus control data. These potential perturbations are summarized in Table ~\ref{tab:perturbations}
