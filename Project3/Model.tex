\section{Model}

\subsection{Statement of the model} We developed a model which consists of 2 dynamic variables representing the line density of lamin A/C, $a(t)$, and lamin B, $b(t)$, as functions of time, $t$ on a simple closed curve in 2D, $s(t)$, enclosing an area, $\mathcal{A}(t)$. The details of laminA/C (B)  assembly and dissassembly into the lamina are unknown, we assume usual assembly kinetics and allow for possible feedback in the dissassembly terms. It is known that lamin proteins are not confined to the nuclear lamina, but exist in the nucleoplasm where they may be performing other functions, including gene regulation ~\cite{Hozak1995, Hutchison2002}. We will assume there is a pool of nuclear lamins which exchanges dynamically with the the lamins in the nuclear lamina. The resulting equations are:

\begin{align}
\dfrac{\partial a}{\partial t} = \dfrac{k_{on}^a}{\mathcal{A}(t)} a_{nuc} - k_{off}^a (s,b)a\\[7pt]
\dfrac{\partial b}{\partial t} = \dfrac{k_{on}^b}{\mathcal{A}(t)}b_{nuc} - k_{off}^b  (s,a)b \label{eq::laminaKinetics}
\end{align}

The parameters $k_{on}^a , k_{on}^b$  govern assembly of lamin A/C, and lamin B into the lamina, respectfully. The functions $k_{off}^a (s,b) = k_{off}^{0a} + \Phi_a(s,b)$ and $ k_{off}^b(s,a)  = k_{off}^{0b} + \Phi_b(s,a)$ describe laminar turnover with possible feedback terms arising from $\Phi$ to be explored in future work and will be further discussed in Section ~\ref{sec:futurework}. The nuclear pools of lamin A/C (B) are labelled by $a_{nuc} (b_{nuc})$. We therefore have the following conservation of lamin equations:

\begin{align}
a_{tot}= \int_0^{\mathcal{L}_0} a(s,t) ds + a_{nuc}\\
b_{tot} = \int_0^{\mathcal{L}_0} b(s,t) ds + b_{nuc}
\end{align}

Where $\mathcal{L}_0$ is the length of the perimeter of a nucleus.  These equations are coupled to a mechanical description of the lamina via the energy functional:

\begin{align}
\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{E}_{stretch} + \mathcal{E}_{pressure} +\mathcal{E}_{bending} + \mathcal{E}_{cytoskeleton} + k_B\mathcal{T} \xi
\end{align}
Where 
\begin{align}
\mathcal{E}_{stretch} = \displaystyle \int_0^{\mathcal{L}_0} \dfrac{1}{2} (\mathcal{G}_a(a(s)) +\mathcal{G}_b(b(s)) )\left( \left |\left| \dfrac{\partial \vec{x} }{\partial s} \right|\right| - 1\right)^2 ds \\
\mathcal{E}_{pressure}  = \mathcal{P} \left( \dfrac{\mathcal{A}}{\mathcal{A}_0} -1\right)^2  \\
\mathcal{E}_{bending} = \displaystyle\int_0^{\mathcal{L}_0} \dfrac{1}{2 } (\mathcal{M}_a(a(s)) + \mathcal{M}_b (b(s)) \left|\left| \dfrac{\partial^2 \vec{x}}{\partial s^2} \right|\right|^2 ds\\
\mathcal{E}_{cytoskeleton} = \displaystyle\int_0^{\mathcal{L}_0} \mathcal{F}_{cyto} (a(s))\Theta (\theta) || \vec{x} || ds 
\end{align}
and \[ \Theta (\theta) = \dfrac{e^{\cos(2\theta)/\sigma_{\rm VM }}}{\int_0^{ 2\pi} e^{\cos(2\theta)/\sigma_{\rm VM}}d \theta} \]

The lamina is modeled as an elastic material where the first term, $\mathcal{E}_{stretch}$ corresponds to laminar surface tension. The next term, $\mathcal{E}_{pressure}$ is the intranuclear pressure, possibly due to chromatin. The third term,$\mathcal{E}_{bending}$  is bending resistance terms due to lamin-lamin crosslinking. It is known that there are non-negligible forces produced by the cellular cytoskeleton(actin and microtubules) which act on the lamins via nuclear transmembrane proteins ~\cite{Haque2010} and so the fourth term, $\mathcal{E}_{cytoskeleton}$, is due to this. Finally we include a term for thermal fluctuations generalized to 2D, $k_B\mathcal{T} \xi$. A cartoon schematic of the model is shown in Fig. ~\ref{fig::model}.

Several of the mechanical parameters are in fact functions of the local densities of laminar lamin proteins, thus connecting the mechanical properties of the lamina (and therefore the nucleus) to the mechanical properties of lamin. A complete list of parameter descriptions can be found in Table ~\ref{tab:nucmodelparameters}.

We non dimensionalized the system by choosing characteristic scales for length, time, energy and amount of lamin. The details of this non-dimensionalization procedure can be found in Appendix ~\ref{sec:project2}. The resulting non-dimensional system is expressed by the following system of equations:

\begin{align}
\dfrac{\partial A}{\partial \tau} &= \kappa_{on}\dfrac{1}{\lambda (\tau)} A_{nuc}  - (\kappa_{off}+ \phi_A (S,B)) A,  \\[10pt]
\dfrac{\partial B}{\partial \tau} &= \dfrac{1}{\lambda (\tau)} B_{nuc}  - (1+ \phi_B (S,A)) B  \\[10pt]
\end{align}
With Energy 
\begin{align}
 E = \displaystyle \int_0^{2 \sqrt{\pi}} \dfrac{1}{2} (G_A(A(S))+ G_B(B(S)))\left( \left |\left|  \dfrac{\partial \vec{\chi} }{\partial S} \right|\right| - 1\right)^2  dS + \Pi \left(\dfrac{\lambda(\tau)}{\lambda_0} -1\right)^2\\[10pt]
 +\displaystyle\int_0^{2\sqrt{\pi}} \dfrac{1}{2 } (M_A(A(S))+ M_B(B(S)))\left|\left| \dfrac{\partial^2 \vec{\chi}}{\partial S^2} \right|\right|^2 dS\\[10pt]
+ \displaystyle\int_0^{2\sqrt{\pi}} F_{cyto}(A(S))\Theta (\theta) \left|\left| \vec{\chi} \right|\right| dS +k_BT \xi
\end{align}

\subsection{Numerical implementation of the model}

The model is implemented in Matlab by discretizing the 2D simple closed curve into a series of nodes connected by linear springs with an elastic modulus dependent on the amount of lamins at the two nodes on either side of each spring. We solve the ODE systems using the forward Euler method. The energy minimization is done using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method at each step forward in time. 

\subsection{Tuning the model}

Many of the mechanical parameters of the model are unknown because they are difficult or impossible to measure experimentally. We therefore have to tune the parameters in our model using some data. We used data from a series of experiments conducted on rat cardiomyocytes grown on fibronectin islands of various shapes and sizes as shown in Fig. \ref{fig::nancycells} ~\cite{Drew2016}. The features we extracted from the images are cellular aspect ratio, F-actin OOP (a measure of the anisotropy in the F-actin network), nuclear eccentricity, nuclear area, and nuclear perimeter. 

\begin{figure}[h]

\label{fig::nancycells}
\end{figure}

In order to extract information about the correlations between these features we plotted each against the others in a scatter plot matrix, see Fig. ~\ref{fig::scattermatrix}. While most of the data appear uncorrelated, there is a clear correlation between F-actin OOP and nuclear eccentricity (R$^2$ = 0.42), and other attributes suitable for fitting. In particular, we chose three patterns in the data to fit our model, nuclear area, nuclear perimeter and correlation between F-actin OOP and nuclear eccentricity. We first chose a subset of the cell which have low F-actin OOP and tuned parameters to match the histograms of nuclear area and nuclear perimeter in both mean and standard deviation. This subset of cells was chosen so that we could assume isotropic cytoskeletal force and therefore set it to 0. Once these parameters were tuned (Fig. ~\ref{fig::histos}), we returned to the entire data set and tuned our model to match the eccentricity vs F-actin OOP plot, see Fig. ~\ref{fig::eccopp}. This gave us estimate of $F_{cyto}$ which is in fact a ratio of two dimensional quantities, $\mathcal{F}_{cyto}$ and  $\mathcal{G}_b$. Since the traction force of actin has been measured experimentally ~\cite{Kuo2012}, we were able to back-calculate and to obtain order of magnitude estimates for all our mechanical parameters. These estimates are summarized in Table ~\ref{tab:OoMest}.
