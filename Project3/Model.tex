\section{Model}
We developed a model which consists of 2 dynamic variables representing the line density of Lamin A/C and Lamin B as functions of time, $t$ on a simple closed curve in 2D, enclosing an area, $A(t)$ . The details of LaminA/C (B)  assembly and dissassembly into the lamina are unknown, we assume
